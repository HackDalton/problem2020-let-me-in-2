# HackDalton: Let me in 2

## Problem:

My friend finally upgraded the security on his website; however he forgot his password again. He remembered that his username is `admin`, but he needs to get into the site without his password.  

## Hints
1. Read about [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). [This article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/sql-injection/) is pretty helpful.
2. Try typing `'` in the password field and using the error message to help debug your code.

Look at the writeup [here](./WRITEUP.md).
